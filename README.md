# Langton's Ant Simulation

An interactive web-based simulation of Langton's Ant, a cellular automaton that creates complex patterns from simple rules.

## Description

Langton's Ant is a two-dimensional Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. The ant follows these rules:
- On a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, and move forward
- On a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, and move forward

## Features

- Interactive canvas-based visualization
- Adjustable simulation speed
- Start, stop, and reset controls
- Step counter
- Responsive design
- Modern UI

3. Click "Start" to begin the simulation
4. Use the speed slider to adjust the simulation speed
5. Click "Stop" to pause or "Reset" to start over
